# Starbound Bind Menu
The Bind Menu is a tech mod that allows you to bind functions to regions on an interface. The interface can be toggled on and off in-game and you can select a region to call the bound functions.
The mod is mostly just meant for use by multiplayer tech modders. It won't really do anything by itself.

## Limitations
* Low refresh rate.
 * A projectile is spawned every half a second to prevent performance loss (2Hz).  
 This is done to keep the mod multiplayer-compatible.
* You'll see other people using a Bind Menu.
* Probably a bunch more. Report issues on the [Issues page](https://github.com/Silverfeelin/Starbound-BindMenu/issues)!
